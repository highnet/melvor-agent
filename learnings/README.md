## Protocol: encode efficiencies in code, not in planning sessions

When an efficiency is found — a cheap upgrade worth buying, a token worth
claiming, a conversion worth doing, a faster variant of the same action — the
work is not "do it". The work is **make the agent do it without being told**.

A planning session that notices something is a session that will not notice it
next time, and the operator should not be the mechanism. Every efficiency found
by looking at the screen is a reflex, a candidate, or a guard that was missing.

Worked examples, all from one session:

| Found | Wrong fix | Right fix |
|---|---|---|
| 50 GP axe unbought at 43,860 GP | buy it | reflex buys cheap permanent upgrades |
| 10,000 GP axe unbought at 58,733 GP | buy it | raise the reflex's band to 25% |
| Mastery Tokens sitting in the bank | claim them | reflex claims them, sell guard refuses them |
| Farming seeds on the sell list | do not sell them | sell reader excludes every seed |
| Mind Runes sold, Magic unusable | craft more | sell reader excludes runes a castable spell needs |

The tell is a sentence beginning "we should" — if it is true now it will be true
tomorrow, and tomorrow nobody is watching.

Corollary: prefer the guard that makes the mistake unavailable over the fix that
makes it undone. A sell list that cannot offer seeds is stronger than a planner
that remembers not to pick them.

## If the fix is free, it is never a plan

The protocol above says encode efficiencies in code. This is its sharp edge, and
it was learned by killing the character.

The food reserve ran out during Thieving. An hour earlier I had looked at
exactly that shortfall, added a warning, and argued in the commit message for
*reporting* it rather than acting: restocking is a real plan — fish, then cook,
then come back — and a reflex would send the agent off fishing mid-objective.

Both halves were wrong.

**The asymmetry was backwards.** A detour costs minutes. Running out costs the
character. When one branch is recoverable and the other is not, "let the planner
decide" is not caution; it is a bet that someone is watching.

**The premise was false, and checkable.** Passive cooking does not take the
action slot. Its own candidate label says so: *"runs in the background of
whatever else is happening."* I had read that line a dozen times that day. There
was never a trade-off to delegate — cooking while Thieving is free.

Every ingredient was present when it died: sixteen Raw Beef, nineteen Raw
Shrimp, Cooking 22, two idle cookers, and a warning I had written myself. It
starved surrounded by food it could have cooked.

The test before deciding something belongs to the planner:

1. Does acting cost anything the agent cannot get back? If no, reflex.
2. Does *not* acting cost something it cannot get back? If yes, reflex.
3. Is the "cost" I am protecting actually real — or did I infer it? Check.

Step 3 is the one that failed. The others were reasoning; this was a fact
sitting in a string literal.

## Verify the outcome, not just the data

The dump said Golbin drops Garum Seeds. That was true, and it was not the
question. The question was whether *this character* could kill a Golbin, and
the answer was no: Magic 2 does too little damage to finish one.

The failure was silent in every way that matters. `combat.engage` returned ok.
The panel said "Doing: Combat". Air Runes drained, so spells were being cast.
Food was eaten every minute, so damage was being taken. Everything looked like
a fight. Nothing died.

What actually exposed it was a number that did not move: GP frozen at exactly
30,816 across three state reads fifteen minutes apart, with no Bones
accumulating from a monster that drops them. Switching to Thieving moved GP
within one report.

The general rule, which cost a plan to learn twice in one day:

- **A capability check is not an outcome check.** "The game accepted the
  action" and "the action achieved something" are different claims, and the
  adapter can only ever prove the first.
- **Pick the counter before starting.** Decide in advance which number must
  move — GP, a drop, a level — and check it early. A fight that produces
  nothing looks identical to a fight that is about to produce something, and
  the only difference is a counter.
- **Excitement about a finding is when to be most careful.** The Golbin drop
  was a genuine discovery from real data, and it went straight into a
  twelve-hour plan without a single kill being confirmed first.
