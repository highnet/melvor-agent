/**
 * Exports the game's own data registries.
 *
 * These registries are ground truth: they are correct for the exact installed
 * version, which the wiki is not. Everything numeric the planner ever sees
 * originates here. The dump is stamped with `gameVersion` so a game update
 * makes the staleness detectable rather than silent.
 *
 * Only the slices Phase 1 and the Phase 2 combat gate need are exported. This
 * is deliberate: `game.items` alone is thousands of entries, and a dump nobody
 * reads is just a large file that goes stale.
 *
 * @returns A structured dump ready to be serialised to `knowledge/dump.json`.
